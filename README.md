## State manage system
Context API which provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level (prevents prop drilling or unnecesary state lifting)
<br>
## Input Validation 
Both front-end and back-end validation for preventing improperly formed data.
<br>
## Authentication 
JWT stored inside an httpOnly cookie to make sure no one can get access to it. Cookie requests are send to the server.
## Automatic code styling
Snippets are automatically styled by the use of PrismJS library
